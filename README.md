# deepdream-tensorflow
Working through the tensorflow deepdream tutorial/example [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/deepdream/deepdream.ipynb), to learn more about tensorflow, and hopefully end up with some tools to help working with deepdream type image generation.

A work in progress.

### Changes
- Replaced IPython and PImage dependencies with opencv for image display and saving.


### Dependencies
- tensorflow 1.0.0 + (tested on tensorflow-gpu 1.1.0) 
- CUDA and cuDNN (to run on GPU)
- python 3.5
- opencv 3.2
- numpy
